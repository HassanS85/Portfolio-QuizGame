//what i have completed: A quiz game made in HTML, CSS and JS featuring multiple choice questions

Created HTML to set out the quiz format using a combination of IDs and some classes.

Created CSS to style the quiz with different font, color, and used cursor pointer for the options on the quiz.

Used JS to create functions - used ternary operators for the first time - as well as event listeners for the first time.

and instructions
